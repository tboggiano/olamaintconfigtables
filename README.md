# Ola Hallengren Maintenance Confirguation Tables
This are tables and jobs that can use to run Ola's scripts as T-SQL Jobs and run on Linux but allow you to customize jobs across all
servers by changing values in a tables instead of in SQL Agent jobs.  Very useful if you are using MSX/TSX.

See blog posts published for them at {https://tracyboggiano.com/archive/2017/11/configuration-tables-for-ola-hallengrens-scripts/] and Automatically Take Missed Backups with Ola Hallengren's Scripts [https://tracyboggiano.com/archive/2022/11/automatically-taâ€¦g-missed-backups/].
